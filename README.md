# Overpressure
This project will analyze an explosion pressure vs. time profile and calcuate the following blast parameters:
* peak overpressure,
* rise time,
* positive phase duration,
* incident impulse.

The project will also remove and DC bias before calulating any of the blast parameters.

This file will become your README and also the index of your documentation.
